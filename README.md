# Live agent-server metrics collector

*MetricKit* - a distributed monitoring solution for Go applications. Deploy lightweight agents to collect runtime and custom metrics from multiple systems, with centralized analysis, real-time alerting, and flexible reporting. Built for production environments requiring comprehensive observability with minimal overhead.

## Motivation

Distributed systems demand continuous monitoring to maintain reliability and performance, yet many existing solutions are either too heavyweight for smaller deployments or lack the granular control needed for Go-specific runtime metrics.

MetricKit was born from the need for:

*üéØ Proactive System Health*

Real-time visibility into critical system parameters before they become incidents. Understanding memory pressure, GC behavior, and resource utilization patterns helps prevent cascading failures in production environments.

*‚ö° Lightweight Monitoring*

Many monitoring solutions consume significant resources themselves. MetricKit prioritizes minimal overhead while providing comprehensive insights - essential for resource-constrained environments or cost-sensitive deployments.

*üîß Go-Native Observability*

Purpose-built for Go applications with deep runtime introspection. Track goroutine leaks, memory allocation patterns, GC pressure, and other Go-specific metrics that generic monitoring tools often miss or handle poorly.

*üéõÔ∏è Operational Control*

Fine-grained control over what gets monitored, how often, and when alerts fire. Different environments (development, staging, production) have different sensitivity requirements - MetricKit adapts to your operational needs rather than forcing you to adapt to the tool.

*üìä Learning Through Building*

Understanding monitoring systems deeply by building one from scratch. This hands-on approach reveals the complexities of distributed metrics collection, data aggregation, and alerting logic that using existing tools often abstracts away.
